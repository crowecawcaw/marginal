[ ] in markdown code view, add syntax highlighting to the markdown.
[x] add table support to presentation view. should render tables, allow editing of cell content, allow add row/column above/below, allow delete rows/columns.
  [x] support drag and drop to add rows. similar to a resize interaction except as you drag the bottom right corner of a table, it adds new rows and columns. on release, the rows/columns are acutally added. dragging in to the table does not remove any rows or columns.
